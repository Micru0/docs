# Notion Connector

Macru seamlessly integrates with your Notion workspace, allowing you to ingest documents, notes, and database entries. This brings your valuable Notion content into your centralized Macru knowledge base for unified querying and insights.

<Info>
  Key development phases for this connector include initial OAuth setup and token management (`devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-24]`), implementation of automatic background sync (`devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-30]`), and enhancements for structured metadata handling (`devlog.txt`: `[2025-05-01]`).

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure OAuth 2.0" icon="lock-keyhole">
    Authorize Macru to access your Notion workspace securely using Notion's standard OAuth 2.0 flow. Your tokens are stored securely.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comprehensive Content Ingestion" icon="file-import">
    Fetches page content and structured properties (like Status, Date, People, Select) from your selected Notion pages and databases.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rich Structured Metadata" icon="tags">
    Extracts relevant Notion properties and stores them as structured metadata in Macru's `documents` table, enabling precise filtering and querying.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Background Sync" icon="arrows-rotate">
    A Supabase Edge Function (`sync-notion-all-users`) periodically syncs your Notion data (e.g., every 6 hours), keeping Macru up-to-date. See `devlog.txt [2025-04-30]`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Sync Control" icon="hand-point-up">
    A "Sync Now" button in the Macru settings allows you to trigger an immediate synchronization of your Notion data whenever needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Source Timestamp Preservation" icon="clock">
    Original Notion page `createdTime` and `lastEditedTime` are captured and stored as `source_created_at` and `source_updated_at` in Macru, enabling time-based queries. (`devlog.txt [2025-04-30]`)

## Connecting Your Notion Workspace

Follow these steps to connect Notion to Macru:

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** page in your Macru dashboard.
2.  Locate the **Notion** integration section under "Connections" or a similar heading.
3.  Click the **"Connect"** button.
4.  You will be redirected to Notion to authorize Macru. 
    <Tip>During this step, Notion will likely ask you to select the specific pages or databases you want to grant Macru access to. Choose these carefully to control what data is ingested.</Tip>
5.  After successfully authorizing, you'll be redirected back to Macru.
6.  The connection status (often including your connected workspace name) will update in the Macru settings, indicating a successful link.

## Data Syncing Behavior

*   **Initial Sync**: When you first connect your Notion workspace, or when you trigger a "Sync Now" manually, Macru will attempt to fetch and ingest data from the Notion pages/databases you granted access to.
*   **Automatic Background Sync**: As noted in the `devlog.txt` entry `[2025-04-30]`, a Supabase Edge Function (`sync-notion-all-users`) is scheduled to run periodically (e.g., every 6 hours). This function triggers the sync process for all users who have an active Notion connection, ensuring your Macru knowledge base stays relatively current with your Notion workspace without manual intervention.
*   **Metadata Updates**: Manual syncs (via the "Sync Now" button) are configured to attempt metadata updates even for previously synced documents. This helps ensure that changes to structured properties in Notion (like a status change) are reflected in Macru (`devlog.txt [2025-05-01]`).
*   **Source Timestamps**: Macru captures the `createdTime` and `lastEditedTime` from your Notion pages. These are stored in the `documents` table as `source_created_at` and `source_updated_at` respectively. This allows for potential future features like querying documents based on their original creation or modification dates in Notion.

## Token Management and Security

*   **OAuth Tokens**: Access to your Notion data is managed via OAuth 2.0 tokens obtained during the authorization process.
*   **Secure Storage**: These tokens are securely stored in the `connector_tokens` table in Macru's Supabase database.
    *   The `devlog.txt` entry `[2025-04-24]` mentions that while the `connector_tokens` table was created with `BYTEA` for tokens and RLS, actual encryption using `pgsodium` or Supabase Vault was a future consideration. Please refer to the latest security documentation or system status for current encryption practices.
*   **Disconnection**: If you choose to disconnect Notion from Macru via the settings page, Macru will delete the stored tokens, revoking its access to your Notion workspace.

<Note icon="triangle-exclamation">
  **Troubleshooting Connection Issues:** The `devlog.txt` entry `[2025-05-01]` under "Post-Implementation Debugging & Fixes" for the Notion Connector details a past issue with token storage and UI responsiveness. If you experience persistent connection problems, this log might offer insights, though the issue was resolved by correcting token handling and UI dependencies.
</Note>

## Technical Implementation Details

For developers interested in the underlying mechanics:

*   **Core Connector Logic**: `lib/connectors/notion.ts` (implements the `DataConnector` interface).
*   **Authentication Flow**:
    *   OAuth Start: `app/api/connectors/notion/auth/start/route.ts`
    *   OAuth Callback: `app/api/connectors/notion/auth/callback/route.ts` (handles token exchange and storage).
*   **Supporting Endpoints**:
    *   Status Check: `app/api/connectors/notion/status/route.ts`
    *   Disconnection: `app/api/connectors/notion/disconnect/route.ts`
    *   Sync Trigger: `app/api/sync/notion/route.ts`
*   **Background Synchronization**: Supabase Edge Function `supabase/functions/sync-notion-all-users/index.ts`.
*   **Key Libraries**: `@notionhq/client` (Official Notion JavaScript SDK).

## Data Handling and Metadata

Macru processes Notion data as follows:

*   **Structured Property Mapping**: When fetching data, the connector intelligently attempts to map standard Notion properties (such as Status, Date, People, Select options) to the corresponding structured metadata columns in Macru's `documents` table.
*   **Timestamps**: Original Notion page `createdTime` and `lastEditedTime` are preserved and stored as `source_created_at` and `source_updated_at` in the `documents` table, respectively.
*   **Source Identification**: The Notion Page ID is typically stored as the `source_id` in Macru, providing a clear link back to the original content.

<Card title="Important Note on Metadata Extraction" icon="info-circle">
    The successful extraction and accurate storage of structured metadata (like a specific 'Status' or 'Due Date') depend significantly on the presence and consistent naming conventions of corresponding properties within your source Notion pages and databases. Macru looks for common property names and types, but custom or unusually named properties might not be mapped automatically.
