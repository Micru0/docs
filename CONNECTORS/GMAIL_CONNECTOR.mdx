# Gmail Connector

Macru integrates with your Gmail account, enabling you to ingest email data directly into your personal knowledge base. This allows your important email communications to be searched, queried, and synthesized alongside information from all other connected sources.

<Info>
  The initial implementation of this connector, including OAuth, data fetching, and display/linking fixes, is detailed in `devlog.txt` entries: `[2025-05-07] Gmail Connector Implementation (Initial)` and `[2025-05-07] Gmail Connector Source Display Fixes`.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure OAuth 2.0" icon="lock-keyhole">
    Authorize Macru to access your Gmail account securely using Google's standard OAuth 2.0 flow. Scopes requested typically include `gmail.readonly`, `userinfo.email`, and `openid`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comprehensive Email Ingestion" icon="mailbox">
    Retrieves email content including important headers (Subject, From, Date) and the full email body.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intelligent Body Parsing" icon="file-lines-alt">
    Attempts to parse the email body effectively, preferring plain text versions when available and applying basic HTML stripping for other formats to extract clean content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recent Email Focus (Initial Sync)" icon="sparkles">
    The first sync after connecting focuses on fetching recent emails (e.g., from the last 24 hours, using `newer_than:1d` filter) for timely data access. (`devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Sync Control" icon="hand-point-up">
    A "Sync Now" button in Macru settings allows you to trigger an immediate synchronization of your Gmail data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct Source Linking & Display" icon="link">
    Ingested emails store the email subject as the title and a direct `gmailUrl` for easy linking back to the original message. (`devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token Refresh Handling" icon="key-skeleton-left-right">
    The connector is designed to handle OAuth token refresh automatically to maintain persistent access.

## Connecting Your Gmail Account

Follow these steps to connect your Gmail account to Macru:

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** page in your Macru dashboard.
2.  Locate the **Gmail** integration section under "Connections" or a similar area.
3.  Click the **"Connect"** button.
4.  You will be redirected to Google to authorize Macru. You will need to grant permission for Macru to read your emails and access basic profile information (which includes your email address for identification).
    <Tip icon="lightbulb-on">
      Similar to other Google service integrations, if your Google Cloud OAuth consent screen is marked as "unverified" during development, you may need to add your email address as a **test user** in the Google Cloud Console under "OAuth consent screen" settings to proceed with authorization.
    </Tip>
5.  After successful authorization, you will be redirected back to Macru.
6.  The connection status, including the email address of the connected Google account, will be updated and displayed in your Macru settings.

## Data Syncing Behavior

*   **Initial Sync**: As highlighted in the `devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`, when you first connect your Gmail account or trigger a manual "Sync Now", the connector is configured to fetch only recent emails (e.g., those received in the last 24 hours using a `newer_than:1d` filter with the Gmail API). This is to ensure a quick and relevant initial ingestion.
*   **Subsequent Syncs**: The architecture supports `lastSyncTime` for future implementation of true delta syncs, which would allow Macru to fetch only emails received or modified since the last successful synchronization.
*   **Manual Sync**: You can trigger a sync at any time using the "Sync Now" button in the settings. This will re-apply the initial sync logic (e.g., fetching recent items) until delta sync is fully implemented.

## Token Management and Security

*   **OAuth Tokens**: Access to your Gmail data is managed via OAuth 2.0 tokens.
*   **Secure Storage**: These tokens are securely stored in the `connector_tokens` table in Macru's Supabase database.
*   **Token Refresh**: The `getConnectionStatus` method within the Gmail connector includes logic to refresh the access token using the stored refresh token if the current one is expired or nearing expiry. This ensures uninterrupted access without requiring you to re-authenticate frequently.
*   **Disconnection**: If you choose to disconnect Gmail from Macru via the settings page, Macru will revoke the tokens with Google and delete the stored tokens from its database, severing access to your Gmail data.

## Technical Implementation Details

For developers interested in the underlying mechanics:

*   **Core Connector Logic**: `lib/connectors/gmail.ts` (includes `transformMessage` for parsing email content, headers, extracting subject for title, and constructing `gmailUrl`).
*   **Authentication Flow**:
    *   OAuth Start: `app/api/connectors/gmail/auth/start/route.ts`
    *   OAuth Callback: `app/api/connectors/gmail/auth/callback/route.ts` (handles token exchange and storage).
*   **Supporting Endpoints**:
    *   Status Check: `app/api/connectors/gmail/status/route.ts` (verifies connection, handles token refresh).
    *   Disconnection: `app/api/connectors/gmail/disconnect/route.ts`
    *   Sync Trigger: `app/api/sync/gmail/route.ts`
*   **Key Libraries**: `googleapis`.

## Data Handling and Metadata

Macru processes Gmail data as follows:

*   **Email Retrieval**: Uses `gmail.users.messages.list` (with filters like `newer_than:1d`) and `gmail.users.messages.get`.
*   **Content Transformation**: The `transformMessage` function in `lib/connectors/gmail.ts` is key. It extracts headers (Subject, From, Date), prefers plain text body parts, and applies basic HTML stripping to others. The email `Subject` is specifically mapped to `metadata.title` (`devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`).
*   **Title Storage**: The email subject is stored in the `documents.title` column, ensuring it's displayed correctly in search results and references (`devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`).
*   **Source URL**: A `gmailUrl` (e.g., `https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox/[MESSAGE_ID]`) is constructed and stored in `documents.source_url`, making emails in Macru directly linkable to their Gmail source (`devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`).
*   **Source Identification**: The Gmail Message ID is stored as `source_id`, and `fileName` in the `ConnectorData` is also set to the message ID.
*   **Ingestion Pipeline**: The processed content and metadata are passed to `lib/services/document-processor.ts`, which now prioritizes `providedMetadata.title` (from the connector) for the document title, and correctly populates `source_url` (`devlog.txt [2025-05-07]`).
