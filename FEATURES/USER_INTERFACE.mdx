# User Interface Overview

Macru provides a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface, built with modern web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Core Technologies

*   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) with React Server Components and TypeScript.
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.
*   **Component Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for a set of pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI components. This ensures a consistent look and feel across the application.
*   **Theme Switching**: Supports light and dark modes using `next-themes`, allowing users to choose their preferred visual theme.

*The initial project setup including these technologies is noted in `devlog.txt` entry `[2025-03-25] Initial Project Setup`. Theme provider and toggle implementation are covered in `[2025-03-28] User Profile Management and Navigation`.*

## Key UI Components & Dashboard Features

Macru's dashboard (`app/dashboard/`) provides access to its core functionalities through various UI elements:
