Macru provides a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface, meticulously built with modern web technologies to ensure a seamless and productive user experience. The design prioritizes ease of use, clarity, and efficient access to Macru's powerful features.

## Core Technologies

The user interface is built upon a robust stack of modern web technologies:

*   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (specifically the App Router) with React Server Components and TypeScript, enabling a fast, scalable, and maintainable frontend.
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid development of custom and responsive designs.
*   **Component Library**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) provides a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components, ensuring a consistent and high-quality look and feel across the application.
*   **Theme Switching**: Supports light and dark modes through ``next-themes``, allowing users to personalize their visual experience.

<Note>
  The initial project setup incorporating these technologies is noted in `devlog.txt` entry `[2025-03-25] Initial Project Setup`. Theme provider and toggle implementation are covered in `[2025-03-28] User Profile Management and Navigation`.

## Key UI Components & Dashboard Features

Macru's main dashboard (located in ``app/dashboard/``) serves as the central hub, providing access to all core functionalities through a variety of well-thought-out UI elements:

*   **Main Layout & Navigation**:
    *   **Sidebar (``components/layout/Sidebar.tsx``)**: A responsive navigation sidebar allowing easy access to different sections of the dashboard (e.g., Files, Settings, Profile).
    *   **User Dropdown (``components/layout/UserDropdown.tsx``)**: Conveniently located, providing quick access to user profile information and the logout option.
*   **Chat Interface (``components/ui/chat-interface.tsx``)**:
    *   **Query Box (``components/ui/query-box.tsx``)**: The primary input area where users type their natural language questions to interact with Macru.
    *   **Message Display (``components/ui/chat-message.tsx``)**: Clearly displays the conversation history, with distinct styling for user queries and assistant responses. It supports Markdown rendering for rich content in LLM outputs.
    *   **Action Confirmation**: UI elements for confirming or rejecting actions proposed by the LLM are seamlessly integrated into the chat flow.
    *   *Development documented in `devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-24] Query Interface and Response Display Implementation`, refined in `[2025-05-04] LLM Response & Action Handling Refinements`.*
*   **Query History (``components/ui/query-history.tsx``)**:
    *   Allows users to review their past queries and the corresponding LLM responses, facilitating context recall and continued exploration.
    *   May include capabilities for searching and filtering past interactions.
    *   *Detailed in `devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-27] Query Management System Implementation`.*
*   **File Management (Mainly in ``app/dashboard/files/page.tsx`` using ``components/ui/file-management.tsx``)**:
    *   **File Upload (``components/ui/file-upload.tsx``)**: An intuitive interface for uploading documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), featuring drag-and-drop support and progress tracking for a smooth user experience.
    *   **File List (``components/ui/file-list.tsx``)**: Displays all uploaded files, potentially with options for sorting, searching, and pagination to manage large collections.
    *   Includes functionality for file deletion.
    *   *Development journey in `devlog.txt`: `[2025-03-29] File Upload System Implementation`, `[2025-04-04] Enhanced File Management System`, `[2025-04-06] File Management System Completion`.*
*   **Settings Page (``app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx``)**:
    *   A central hub for all user configurations, often organized with tabs (using ``components/ui/tabs.tsx``) for clarity.
    *   **LLM Selector (``components/ui/LLMSelector.tsx``)**: Enables users to choose their preferred Large Language Model. (See `devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-23] LLM Selector UI and User Preferences Implementation`).
    *   **Data Connector Management**: Sections for securely connecting, disconnecting, and managing data sources like Notion, Google Calendar, and Gmail. (See various connector implementation entries in `devlog.txt`).
    *   **Memory Viewer (``components/ui/memory-viewer.tsx``)**: Allows users to view and manage their stored personalized memories (MEM0). (See `devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-24] Memory Layer Implementation`).
    *   **Audit Trail Viewer (``components/ui/audit-trail-viewer.tsx``)**: Provides a transparent log of actions proposed or executed by the system, enhancing accountability. (See `devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-29] Action Layer Configuration & Security`).
*   **Profile Page (``app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx``)**:
    *   **Profile Form (``components/forms/ProfileForm.tsx``)**: Allows users to view and easily edit their profile information, such as their name and preferred timezone. (See `devlog.txt`: `[2025-03-28] User Profile Management and Navigation`, `[2025-05-05] User Timezone Preference`).
*   **Notifications System**:
    *   Utilizes a non-intrusive toast notification system (powered by ``components/ui/toaster.tsx`` and ``components/ui/use-toast.ts``) to provide timely feedback on operations, errors, or important system messages.
    *   *Implementation detailed in `devlog.txt`: `[2025-04-24] Query Interface and Response Display Implementation`.*

Overall, Macru's UI is designed to be responsive across devices and provide clear status indicators for data ingestion, actions, and other background processes, ensuring a smooth, understandable, and empowering user journey.
