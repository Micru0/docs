title: "Setting Up Mintlify for Macru Documentation"
description: "A guide detailing the initial setup and context for using Mintlify to create and maintain the Macru application documentation."
---

This guide outlines how the Mintlify documentation framework was set up for the Macru project, including the initial steps, source materials, and key configurations.

## Background

The Macru documentation was created to provide comprehensive information about the application, its features, architecture, and development processes. Mintlify was chosen as the framework for building and managing this documentation.

## Initial Setup Process

The setup process for the Macru documentation using Mintlify involved the following key steps, primarily detailed in `Dochistory.mdx`:

1.  **Mintlify Starter Kit**:
    *   Add GitHub repo to mintlify account. This creates a docs repo in Github
    *   The process began by cloning the Mintlify starter kit from `https://github.com/Spa42/docs`.
    *   This cloned starter kit was placed in the directory `/Users/micru/mintlfy/docs/`, which serves as the root for the Macru documentation project.

2.  **Node.js Prerequisite**:
    *   Node.js (version 19 or higher is recommended) is a prerequisite for using Mintlify.

3.  **Installing Mintlify CLI**:
    *   The Mintlify Command Line Interface (CLI) is essential for local development and various documentation management tasks. It's installed globally using npm or yarn, as shown in `development.mdx`:
        <CodeGroup>
          ```bash npm
          npm i -g mintlify
          ```
          ```bash yarn
          yarn global add mintlify
          ```
        </CodeGroup>

## Source Materials for Initial Content

Once the Mintlify environment was ready, the initial documentation content was generated by synthesizing information from several existing Macru project artifacts:

*   **`PRD.txt`**: The Product Requirements Document for Macru.
*   **`devlog.txt`**: A detailed development log tracking features, implementation details, changes, and debugging sessions.
*   **Macru Application `README.md`**: The main readme file for the Macru project.

These sources provided the foundational information for creating the various `.mdx` pages that form the core of the documentation.

## Key Configuration and Development

*   **`docs.json`**: This is the central configuration file for Mintlify. It's located in the root of the documentation directory (`/Users/micru/mintlfy/docs/`). This file controls aspects like:
    *   Documentation name and branding (logo, colors, theme).
    *   Navigation structure (sidebar groups, global anchors).
    *   Initially, this involved updating the documentation `name` to "Macru Documentation" and structuring the navigation based on the generated content. Over time, it has been refined to manage sidebar visibility and theme colors, as detailed in `Dochistory.mdx`.

*   **Local Development**:
    *   To preview changes locally, navigate to the docs directory (`/Users/micru/mintlfy/docs/`) and run the command:
        ```bash
        mintlify dev
        ```
    *   This typically starts a local server at `http://localhost:3000`, allowing for real-time previewing of documentation changes.

## Evolution and Best Practices

The `Dochistory.mdx` file serves as a living record of the documentation's evolution, including:
*   Initial content generation.
*   Refinements using Mintlify components (`<Card>`, `<Note>`, etc.).
*   Troubleshooting steps, particularly regarding `docs.json` configuration for sidebar navigation.
*   Updates to theme and branding.

It's recommended to refer to `Dochistory.mdx` for detailed operational knowledge and best practices specific to maintaining the Macru documentation with Mintlify. The `development.mdx` file also provides general guidance on Mintlify CLI usage, versioning, and troubleshooting common Mintlify issues.

## Challenges and Considerations

While Mintlify provides a streamlined documentation experience, some challenges and considerations encountered or to keep in mind include:

*   **Deployment Platform Lock-in**: Deployment of the documentation is primarily handled through Mintlify's platform, which might be a limitation if alternative hosting or deployment pipelines are preferred.
*   **`docs.json` Configuration Sensitivity**:
    *   The primary configuration file, `docs.json`, has a strict schema. Incorrect structures, especially within the `navigation` object, can lead to build errors or a non-functional sidebar.
    *   Specific formatting for `pages` entries (requiring simple strings instead of objects with icons for individual pages within a group) was a key learning point from troubleshooting, as detailed in `Dochistory.mdx`.
*   **Sidebar Navigation Issues**: Initial setup and modifications to `docs.json` sometimes resulted in the sidebar navigation disappearing or becoming incomplete, requiring careful adherence to the established working configuration.
*   **Limited Customizability beyond Theming**: While theming (colors, fonts) is supported, extensive customization of layout or underlying components might be more restricted compared to building a documentation site from scratch with more general-purpose static site generators.
*   **Dependency on Mintlify CLI and Services**: The workflow relies on the Mintlify CLI and its associated services, meaning updates or changes to these could impact the local development and deployment process.

This setup provides a robust foundation for ongoing documentation development and maintenance for the Macru application.
