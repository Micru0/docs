# Getting Started with Macru

This guide will walk you through the steps to get your Macru application up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   Node.js (version 18.x or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm (package manager)
*   Access to a Supabase project

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the Macru application repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spa42/macru.git
cd macru
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned project directory and install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

## 3. Set up Supabase

Macru relies on Supabase for authentication, database storage, and file storage.

*   **Create a Supabase Project**: If you haven't already, create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
*   **Database Configuration**:
    *   In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to **Database** > **Extensions**.
    *   Enable the `pgvector` extension (for vector similarity search).
    *   Enable the `pgsodium` extension (for future token encryption, if not already enabled).
    *   Go to the **SQL Editor**. Run *all* SQL migration scripts located in the Macru project's `scripts/migrations/` and `supabase/migrations/` directories. **Execute them in numerical order** to correctly set up tables (like `profiles`, `documents`, `chunks`, `embeddings`, `memory_items`, `connector_tokens`, `action_logs`), functions, triggers, and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.
*   **Storage Setup**:
    *   Navigate to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard.
    *   Create the required buckets (e.g., `documents`, `avatars`). Refer to the Macru application's source code or migration scripts for exact names and policies if needed.
*   **Authentication Setup**:
    *   Navigate to **Authentication** > **Configuration** (or Providers).
    *   Ensure Email authentication is enabled.
    *   For local development, you might want to temporarily disable "Confirm email" to streamline testing.
    *   Under **URL Configuration** (or **Auth Settings** > **General**):
        *   Set your **Site URL** (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development).
        *   Add **Redirect URLs**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`.

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Macru requires several environment variables to connect to Supabase and other services.

*   In the root of your Macru project directory (`/Users/micru/macru/macru/`), create a file named `.env.local`.
*   Copy the following structure into `.env.local` and populate it with your actual credentials and keys from your Supabase project and other services:

```env
# Supabase Core
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET # Get from Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > API > JWT Settings

# LLMs (Example for Google Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
# Add keys for other LLMs if configured in llmRouter.ts

# Memory Layer (Optional Toggle - set to 'true' to enable)
# ENABLE_MEMORY_LAYER=false

# Notion Connector (If using)
NOTION_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_NOTION_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID
NOTION_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_NOTION_INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET
NOTION_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/connectors/notion/auth/callback # Ensure this matches your Notion Integration settings

# Internal Sync Trigger (For background sync, e.g., Notion Supabase Function)
INTERNAL_API_SECRET=A_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_SHARED_WITH_SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Use production URL when deployed

# Add other necessary variables for different connectors or services
```

**Important**:
*   Replace placeholder values like `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` with your actual credentials.
*   The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is highly sensitive and should only be used in backend environments.
*   For production deployments, ensure all these variables are securely set in your hosting provider's environment settings, and update `NOTION_REDIRECT_URI` and `APP_URL` to your production URLs.

## 5. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured, you can start the Macru development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## 6. Access Macru

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the Macru application.
