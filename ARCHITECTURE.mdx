# Macru Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the technical architecture of Macru, detailing its system components, data models, APIs, infrastructure, and project structure.

## System Components

Macru is built with a modular architecture composed of several key components, working in concert to deliver a seamless and intelligent experience:

<ResponseField name="Frontend" type="Next.js 14 + TypeScript">
  Located in the ``/app`` and ``/components/ui`` directories. It handles UI rendering, user interactions, and communication with the backend API.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Backend API" type="Next.js API Routes & Supabase Functions">
  Primarily Next.js API Routes (within ``/app/api/``). These serverless functions manage querying, data ingestion, memory, actions, and LLM routing. Supabase Functions (e.g., ``sync-notion-all-users``) handle specific background tasks.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Authentication" type="Supabase Auth">
  Utilizes Supabase Auth for robust user management, including sign-up, login, and session handling.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Database" type="Supabase Postgres + pgvector & pgsodium">
  The primary data store for user profiles, document metadata, text chunks, vector embeddings (via `pgvector`), personalized memories (MEM0), connector tokens (secured with `pgsodium` for future encryption), and action logs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Storage" type="Supabase Storage">
  Securely stores user-uploaded files (PDFs, DOCX) and other assets like avatars.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="LLM Interface" type="lib/llmRouter.ts">
  A crucial routing layer (``lib/llmRouter.ts``) that abstracts interactions with external Large Language Model APIs (e.g., Google Gemini), allowing for flexibility and extensibility.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Memory Module" type="lib/services/memory-service.ts & memory-service-server.ts">
  Provides the interface (client: ``memory-service.ts``, server: ``memory-service-server.ts``) for the MEM0 store, enabling personalized, persistent memory for each user, initially backed by Supabase.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Data Connectors" type="lib/connectors/*">
  Modular components within ``lib/connectors/`` responsible for fetching, transforming, and preparing data from external sources like Notion, Google Calendar, and Gmail.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Embedding Generation Service" type="lib/services/embedding-service.ts">
  Manages the creation of vector embeddings from text chunks, typically leveraging the embedding capabilities of a chosen LLM.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Vector Search" type="pgvector in Supabase">
  Utilizes the `pgvector` extension within Supabase Postgres to perform efficient semantic similarity searches on text embeddings.
</ResponseField>

## Data Models (High-Level)

The core data entities within Macru include:

#### Users
*   Managed by Supabase Auth.
*   Additional profile information (e.g., display name, timezone) stored in the ``profiles`` table.

#### Connector Tokens
*   Table: ``connector_tokens``
*   Stores authentication tokens (e.g., OAuth access/refresh tokens) for connected third-party services, secured by RLS.

#### Documents
*   Table: ``documents``
*   Stores metadata about each ingested item, including:
    *   ``user_id`` (owner)
    *   ``source_id`` (original ID from the source platform)
    *   ``source_type`` (e.g., 'file_upload', 'notion', 'google_calendar_event')
    *   ``title`` and ``source_url``
    *   Timestamps: ``created_at``, ``updated_at``, ``source_created_at``, ``source_updated_at``
    *   Ingestion ``status``
    *   Structured metadata: ``event_start_time``, ``content_status``, ``priority``, ``participants``, ``location``, etc.

#### Chunks
*   Table: ``chunks``
*   Stores segments of text extracted from documents, linked to a parent document via ``document_id``.
*   Includes ``content`` of the text chunk.

#### Embeddings
*   Table: ``embeddings``
*   Stores vector embeddings (type `vector`) corresponding to each text chunk, linked via ``chunk_id``.

#### Memory Items (MEM0)
*   Table: ``memory_items``
*   Stores user-specific key facts, preferences, or contextual notes for the MEM0 layer.
*   Linked to ``user_id`` and protected by RLS.

#### Action Logs
*   Table: ``action_logs``
*   Records proposed and executed actions by the system.
*   Includes ``user_id``, ``action_type``, ``status``, ``params_snapshot``, and timestamps.

#### Query Logs
*   Table: ``queries``
*   Stores user queries and LLM responses for history and potential future analysis.

<Note>
  For detailed table schemas, relationships, and RLS policies, refer to the SQL migration files located in the ``scripts/migrations/`` and ``supabase/migrations/`` directories of the Macru application repository.
</Note>

## APIs and Integrations

Macru's architecture relies on a set of internal and external APIs:

#### Internal APIs
*   The frontend Next.js application communicates with backend Next.js API Routes (in ``/app/api/``) for all dynamic operations. These include:
    *   Authentication requests (login, signup, etc.).
    *   Triggering data ingestion and synchronization for various connectors.
    *   Submitting user queries to the LLM through the ``llmRouter``.
    *   Managing user profile settings, memory items, and other user-specific data.
    *   Proposing and executing actions via the Action Layer.

#### External API Integrations
*   **LLM APIs**: Primarily Google Gemini API (via ``@google/generative-ai``), with ``llmRouter.ts`` designed for easy extension to other providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
*   **Data Source APIs**:
    *   Notion API (via ``@notionhq/client``).
    *   Google APIs (for Calendar and Gmail, via ``googleapis``).
    *   The system is designed to accommodate future integrations (e.g., Google Drive, Linear, Figma).
*   **Supabase APIs**: The application extensively uses Supabase client libraries (``@supabase/supabase-js``, ``@supabase/ssr``) for all interactions with Supabase Auth, Database (Postgres), and Storage.

## Infrastructure Requirements

Running Macru effectively requires the following infrastructure components:

*   **Hosting**: A platform for deploying the Next.js application (e.g., **Vercel**, which is used for the production deployment as per the `devlog.txt`).
*   **Supabase Project**: A foundational Supabase project providing:
    *   User Authentication services.
    *   PostgreSQL database with `pgvector` and `pgsodium` extensions enabled.
    *   Secure File Storage.
    *   Serverless Edge Functions (for background processing tasks).
*   **API Keys & Credentials**: Valid API keys and OAuth credentials are essential for:
    *   The selected Large Language Model(s).
    *   Each external data source Macru integrates with (Notion, Google services, etc.).
    *   These are managed securely via environment variables (e.g., in ``.env.local`` for development or through the hosting provider's settings for production).

## Project Structure Overview
