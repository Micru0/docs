description: "Summary of the steps taken to generate the initial documentation for the Macru application."
---

This document summarizes the process undertaken to create the initial set of documentation for the **Macru** application using the Mintlify documentation framework.

## Goal

The objective was to generate comprehensive documentation based on existing project artifacts, primarily:
*   `PRD.txt`: The Product Requirements Document for Macru.
*   `devlog.txt`: A detailed development log tracking features, changes, and debugging sessions.
*   Macru Application `README.md`: The main readme file for the Macru project.

The documentation was created within a cloned Mintlify starter kit located at `/Users/micru/mintlfy/docs/`.

## Process Summary

1.  **Setup**: Cloned the Mintlify starter kit (`https://github.com/Spa42/docs`).
2.  **Information Gathering**: Read and analyzed content from `PRD.txt`, `devlog.txt`, and the Macru `README.md`.
3.  **Content Generation**: Created the following `.mdx` pages, populating them with information synthesized from the source materials:
    *   `index.mdx`: Introduction and overview of Macru.
    *   `GETTING_STARTED.mdx`: Setup and installation instructions.
    *   `ARCHITECTURE.mdx`: Overview of system components, data models, APIs, infrastructure, and project structure.
    *   `FEATURES/DATA_INGESTION.mdx`: Details on file uploads, connectors, and the document processing pipeline.
    *   `FEATURES/QUERYING_DATA.mdx`: Explanation of the Hybrid Query Engine and Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG).
    *   `FEATURES/MULTI_LLM_ARCHITECTURE.mdx`: Information on supporting multiple LLMs via `llmRouter.ts`.
    *   `FEATURES/MEMORY_LAYER.mdx`: Description of the persistent, personalized memory system.
    *   `FEATURES/ACTION_LAYER.mdx`: Details on proposing and executing actions with user confirmation.
    *   `FEATURES/AUTHENTICATION.mdx`: Explanation of the Supabase Auth implementation.
    *   `FEATURES/USER_INTERFACE.mdx`: Overview of UI components and dashboard features.
    *   `CONNECTORS/NOTION_CONNECTOR.mdx`: Specifics of the Notion integration.
    *   `CONNECTORS/GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CONNECTOR.mdx`: Specifics of the Google Calendar integration.
    *   `CONNECTORS/GMAIL_CONNECTOR.mdx`: Specifics of the Gmail integration.
    *   `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.mdx`: Information for developers, including the database migration workflow.
    *   `TROUBLESHOOTING.mdx`: Compilation of common issues and solutions from the `devlog.txt`.
4.  **Navigation Configuration (`docs.json`)**:
    *   Updated the documentation `name` to "Macru Documentation".
    *   Added all created pages to the navigation structure under relevant groups ("Get Started", "Macru Documentation", "Connectors") within the "Guides" tab.

## Potential Next Steps & Improvements

This initial pass has generated a solid foundation based on the provided materials. Further refinements could include:

*   **Content Review & Refinement**: Read through each generated page for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Add more specific examples or diagrams where helpful.
*   **`docs.json` Cleanup**:
    *   Remove placeholder groups/pages from the starter kit (e.g., the "Essentials" group and its pages, the default "API Reference" tab/pages) if they are not relevant to Macru.
    *   Update the `logo` and `favicon` paths in `docs.json` to use Macru-specific assets.
    *   Customize `navbar` links (e.g., remove default "Dashboard" button, add relevant links for Macru).
    *   Customize `footer` links.
    *   Update `colors` to match Macru's branding, if different.
*   **Address Title Display**: Decide whether to keep the H1 heading in each `.mdx` file or remove it to avoid visual repetition with the title set in the frontmatter. If removing, ensure Mintlify renders the frontmatter title appropriately as the main page heading.
*   **API Documentation**: If Macru exposes a public or internal API and has an OpenAPI specification file, use Mintlify's features (`npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url>`) to generate the API reference section.
*   **Add More Troubleshooting**: As the application evolves, add new common issues and solutions to `TROUBLESHOOTING.mdx`.
*   **Improve Navigation**: Consider reorganizing the groups and tabs in `docs.json` for optimal user navigation as the documentation grows. For example, "Architecture", "Development Guide", and "Troubleshooting" could potentially form their own top-level group or tab.
*   **Visual Enhancements**: Incorporate more Mintlify components (`<Card>`, `<Note>`, `<Warning>`, images, etc.) to improve visual presentation and readability.

## Documentation Enhancement Session (Continued from Previous Summary)

Continuing from the initial documentation generation, this session focused on refining and optimizing the Macru documentation within the Mintlify framework.

**Key Actions and Enhancements:**

1.  **Initial Setup & Context:**
    *   Reviewed Mintlify's documentation using Context7 to understand its features and best practices.

2.  **Streamlining Documentation Content:**
    *   Removed Mintlify's own "Essentials" guide files (`essentials/*.mdx`) to focus purely on Macru's documentation.

3.  **Configuration (`docs.json`) Updates:**
    *   Updated the `logo` to point to Macru's logo (`/logo/macru_logo.png`).
    *   Removed the "Essentials" group from the navigation structure.
    *   Added relevant Font Awesome `icon`s to navigation groups ("Get Started," "Macru Documentation," "Connectors").
    *   Revised `navigation.global.anchors` to be Macru-specific, initially with relative paths.
    *   **Correction:** Fixed a Mintlify build error by updating `navigation.global.anchors` `href` values to be valid absolute URLs (pointing to GitHub as placeholders).

4.  **Page Content & Structure Enhancements (using Mintlify components like `<Card>`, `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`, `<CodeGroup>`, and improved Markdown structure):**
    *   **`index.mdx`**: Optimized frontmatter, refined the introduction, presented "Core Principles" using engaging cards, and added a "Dive Deeper" section.
    *   **`GETTING_STARTED.mdx`**: Improved structure with H2 headings for steps, used callouts for prerequisites and important notes, and formatted environment variable examples with `<CodeGroup>`.
    *   **`FEATURES/DATA_INGESTION.mdx`**: Enhanced section clarity, used cards for connector overviews, and improved formatting for technical details.
    *   **`ARCHITECTURE.mdx`**: Added an icon, used `<ResponseField>` components for "System Components," structured "Data Models" with H4s, and improved formatting throughout.
    *   **`FEATURES/QUERYING_DATA.mdx`**: Added an icon, used cards for "Hybrid Query Engine" methods, and enhanced explanations with callouts.
    *   **`FEATURES/MULTI_LLM_ARCHITECTURE.mdx`**: Added an icon, used cards for advantages, and improved formatting for technical terms and devlog references.
    *   **`FEATURES/MEMORY_LAYER.mdx`**: Added an icon, used cards for "Purpose" section, and improved formatting for technical details and devlog notes.
    *   **`FEATURES/ACTION_LAYER.mdx`**: Added an icon, refined explanations, used a `<Warning>` for user confirmation emphasis, and improved overall structure.
    *   **`FEATURES/AUTHENTICATION.mdx`**: Added an icon, polished explanations, grouped devlog references, and ensured consistent code formatting.
    *   **`FEATURES/USER_INTERFACE.mdx`**: Added an icon, expanded descriptions, and ensured consistent code formatting for UI components and paths.
    *   **`CONNECTORS/NOTION_CONNECTOR.mdx`**: Added icon, used cards for features, structured implementation details with H4s, and improved formatting.
    *   **`CONNECTORS/GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CONNECTOR.mdx`**: Added icon, used cards for features, structured implementation details, and improved formatting.
    *   **`CONNECTORS/GMAIL_CONNECTOR.mdx`**: Added icon, used cards for features, structured implementation details, and improved formatting.
    *   **`DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.mdx`**: Added icon, improved structure with H2s/H3s, used callouts for important notes/warnings (especially for the database migration workflow), and enhanced code block formatting.

**Next Planned Step (before this summary):**
*   Enhance the `TROUBLESHOOTING.mdx` page.

This session successfully applied numerous Mintlify best practices and components to make the Macru documentation more visually appealing, structured, and user-friendly. 

## Sidebar Navigation Troubleshooting and Theme Update

Following the previous enhancements, an issue arose where the left sidebar navigation disappeared or was incomplete. Several attempts were made to correct the `docs.json` structure:

1.  Initially, the navigation groups were moved directly under `navigation.groups`, removing a `tabs` wrapper. This led to a schema validation error during the Mintlify build process.
2.  Next, the structure was changed to use `navigation.anchors` as the primary key, with all documentation groups nested under a new "Guides" anchor, and the `navigation.global` object was removed. This also resulted in build errors and a completely missing sidebar.

**Resolution:**
The issue was resolved by carefully restructuring `docs.json` as follows:
*   The main documentation groups ("Get Started", "Macru Documentation", "Connectors") were placed under `navigation.groups`.
*   Crucially, all `pages` entries within these groups were simplified to be strings (filenames only, e.g., `"GETTING_STARTED"`) rather than objects containing `page` and `icon` keys. Icons were kept at the group level.
*   The `navigation.global.anchors` section was reinstated as it was in the original `docs.json` from the starter kit, as this was found to correctly render top-level links (like "Macru Overview" and "Key Features") in the sidebar.

This combination of using `navigation.groups` for the main content structure, `navigation.global.anchors` for top-level sidebar links, and ensuring `pages` arrays contained only strings, successfully restored the sidebar navigation.

Additionally, during this troubleshooting phase, the documentation theme colors were updated:
*   The primary, light, and dark green colors were changed to cyan shades (`#00BCD4`, `#4DD0E1`, and `#0097A7` respectively) in `docs.json`.
